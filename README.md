# slack-link
Allows the linking of the Slack usernames to their associated RPI Ambulance Account

To use first run npm install and then npm start.
You will also have to configure Slack to utilize the command /linkuser @Slack Username RPIA Website ID and /checkuser [@slack usernam]
Note: If you do not turn on escape usernames for both commands this will not work!

If you have any questions please feel free to reach out.
